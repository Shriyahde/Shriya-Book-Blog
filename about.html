            Hello! My name is Shriya and I love to read. I want to expand my love of reading and share it with others by creating a helpful 
            blog for others to enjoy! Here, you can use a website made by readers, for readers. Also, I would like to thank Madelyn H for 
            helping me create this blog. Thank you!!
